### Business Case
In early 2021 Danny opened a little restaurant (Danny's Diner) which sells 3 foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
To help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.
  **"Whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program?"**

## 🍕 Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner 
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;">

### Business Case
Danny was sold on the idea **“80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”**, 
  but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - 
  so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) 
  and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

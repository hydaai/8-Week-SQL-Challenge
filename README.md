### Business Case
In early 2021 Danny opened a little restaurant (Danny's Diner) which sells 3 foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
To help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.
  "Whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program?"

## 🍜 Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner 
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;">

### Business Case
In early 2021 Danny opened a little restaurant (Danny's Diner) which sells 3 foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
To help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.
  **"Whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program?"**

## 🍕 Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner

### Business Case
Danny was sold on the idea **“80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”**, 
  but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - 
  so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) 
  and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

### Business Case
  
Danny launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, 
	giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. 
	**Using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.**

### Business Case
  
Another initiative from Danny - Bank Data - some sort of intersection between Neo-Banks 
  (new aged digital only banks without physical branches), cryptocurrency and the data world.

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.
  **Calculating metrics, growth and analyse data to better forecast and plan for their future developments!**

## 🛒 Case Study #5 - Data Mart 
 <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43850912/145499478-0f201e04-500c-4c2b-8c2c-06f5f4541529.png" width="270" height="270">

### Business Case
  
Data Mart is Danny’s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce.

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart.
  All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

Danny needs help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it’s separate business areas.

The key business question to answer are the following:
- **What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?**
- **Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?**
- **What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?**

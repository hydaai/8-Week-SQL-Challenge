WITH
	week_no --assume 1 year has 52 weeks
AS
	(
		SELECT top 52 
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name) week_no 
		FROM master.sys.all_columns

## 5. *What is the total count of transactions for each platform*

#### Steps:
- Use **WITH common_table_expression** to find total amount each customers per month
- Use **CTE** again to the opening and closing balance
- Use **CTE** again to find out the increase in percent
- Use **WHERE** to filter increase closing balance by more than 5%.

````sql
select
	platform,
	COUNT(*) total_transactions
from clean_weekly_sales
group by platform;
````

## 6. *What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?*

#### Steps:
- Use **WITH common_table_expression** to find the total sales 
- Find out the percentage of Retail and Shopify sales each month.

WITH 
	sales
AS
	(
		select
			calendar_year,
			month_number,
			platform,
			SUM(sales) total_sales
		from clean_weekly_sales
		group by calendar_year, month_number, platform
	)
select
	calendar_year,
	month_number,
	ROUND(100 * MAX(case when platform = 'Retail' 
		then total_sales else NULL end)/ SUM(total_sales), 2) retail_percentage,
	ROUND(100 * MAX(case when platform = 'Shopify' 
		then total_sales else NULL end)/ SUM(total_sales), 2) shopify_percentage
from sales
group by calendar_year, month_number
order by calendar_year, month_number;
````


#### Answer:

## 9. *Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?*

#### Steps:
- Find the average of each sales divided by each transaction as `avg_transaction_row`
- Find average of total sales divided by total transactions as `avg_transaction_group`
- Compare `avg_transaction_row` with `avg_transaction_group`, which one is more accurate?

````sql
select
	calendar_year,
	platform,
	ROUND(AVG(avg_transaction), 2) avg_transaction_row,
	ROUND(SUM(sales)/SUM(transactions), 2) avg_transaction_group
from clean_weekly_sales
group by calendar_year, platform
order by calendar_year, platform;
````


#### Answer:

calendar_year | platform | avg_transaction_row | avg_transaction_group
-- | -- | -- | --
2018 | Retail | 42.91 | 36.56
2018 | Shopify | 188.28 | 192.48
2019 | Retail | 41.97 | 36.83
2019 | Shopify | 177.56 | 183.36
2020 | Retail | 40.64 | 36.56
2020 | Shopify | 174.87 | 179.03

- We can use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year by platfrom.
- However, `avg_transaction_group` (total sales divided by total transactions) is more accurate.

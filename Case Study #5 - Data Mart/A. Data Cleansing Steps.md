### *In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table named clean_weekly_sales:*
- Convert the `week_date` to a **DATE** format
- Add a `week_number` as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 
	8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
- Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called `age_band` after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value:
	| segment| age_band |
	| -- | -- |
	| 1 | Young Adults |
	| 2 | Middle Aged |
	| 3 or 4 | Retirees |
- Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
	| segment | demographic |
	| -- | -- |
	| C	| Couples |
	| F	| Families |
- Ensure all *null* string values with an "*unknown*" string value in the original segment column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
- Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by transactions **round**ed to 2 decimal places for each record

### Create New Table `clean_weekly_sales`
| Column | Actions |
| -- | -- |
| week_date | change datatype to **date** with **CAST**  |
| week_number | return to number of week with **DATEPART** |
| month_number | return to number of month with **DATEPART** |
| calendar_year | return to number of year with **DATEPART** |
| region | no changes |
| platform | no changes |
| segment | no changes |
| age_band | Use **CASE** with conditional statement, 1 = Young Adults, 2 = Middle Aged , 3 or 4 = Retirees , null = unknown |
| demographic | Use **CASE** with conditional statement, C = Couples, F = Families, null = unknown |
| customer_type | no changes |
| transactions | change datatype to **float** |
| sales | change datatype to **float** |
| avg_transaction | Divide sales by transactions and round to 2 decimals |

#### Answer:
````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;
select 
	CAST(week_date as date) week_date,
	DATEPART(WEEK, CAST(week_date as date)) week_number,
	DATEPART(M, CAST(week_date as date)) month_number,
	DATEPART(YY, CAST(week_date as date)) calendar_year,
	region,
	platform,
	segment,
	case when RIGHT(segment, 1) = '1' then 'Young Adults'
		when RIGHT(segment, 1) = '2' then 'Middle Aged'
		when RIGHT(segment, 1) = '3' or RIGHT(segment, 1) = '4' then 'Retirees'
		else 'unknown' end age_band,
	case when LEFT(segment, 1) = 'C' then 'Couples'
		when LEFT(segment, 1) = 'F' then 'Families'
		else 'unknown' end demographic,
	customer_type,
	CAST(transactions as float) transactions,
	CAST(sales as float) sales,
	ROUND(CAST(sales as float)/CAST(transactions as float), 2) avg_transaction
into clean_weekly_sales
from weekly_sales;
````

We got a new table.
